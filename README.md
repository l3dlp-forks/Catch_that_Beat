Catch_that_Beat
===============

Website, created using Javascript, HTML5, Jquery, and some PHP, that functions similarly to GrooveShark. When searching for an artist, song, or album, information (if found) about the searched subject is displayed, along with a list of songs relating to or by that subject. If the searched subject is an artist, a list of alias names is also displayed, and songs related to those aliases would appear in the list of songs. In addition, a slideshow or still image of the subject would be displayed. This site uses the several APIs, such as Flickr, MediaWiki, and Echo Nest.

PURPOSE
=======

I enjoy listening to music. The site I tend to use is Grooveshark. In addition, most of the songs I listen to are by Asian singers. However, there is one slight problem that annoys me when using Grooveshark, and that is having to go to Wikipedia to look up the artist's name written in Chinese, Korean, or Japanese when I am not able to find any songs by that artist. This site was designed to solve this problem.

HOW TO
======

Simply look up the artist, song title, or album name that you wish to listen to. The information about that artist, song, or album will display along with an image or slideshow of the input, and a list of songs. When an artist is searched, the aliases of that artist is displayed. In addition, the songs by the artist's aliases are included in the list of songs. Scroll to the songs in the list that you wish to listen to and click on the image before the song. This would add the song to the playlist in the music player.
